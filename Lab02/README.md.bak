1.I guess a woarning will show.
2.first, putting scanf() into each functions means we have to add printf() and scanf() 
into each functions, obviously. It will use lots of storing space, althought, it works
no different than the another way in user's experience. As a coder coding my code into 
a high efficiency is important.
second, I guess it will cause some problem in the future.

this lab tooks me a loooooooooong time to figure out how scanf() works. However, it still 
unwork. I'm thinking I maybe should replace a new kit. This lab is finished without see
hwo scanf() works! Hope the future labs do not need anything input.879789
