I don't know what is timing experiment in sort.c. I think the insertion sort is quicker than 
selection sort. insertion sort does not need to compare every elements in list but selection
sort needs.

This lab is quite fun. I noticed the change for different situations about previous and next
items at begining. Hence, not too many errors pump out this time. 

For this lab, the test file is not useful like last one. Therefor I just generally coding 
everything and test them. However, I deeply thought how each thing works at first. This 
made huge progress for me. 

I think I complete the lab. It is a worthwhile lab because I can find a clear thinking path.
The previous labs are chaotic. Thinking is not important. Iteration for each bug is the main 
rhythm. Hope next one works the same as this one.
