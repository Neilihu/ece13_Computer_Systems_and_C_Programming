Introduction:
I collaborate with Junhao Lai (jali38@ucsc.edu). We communicated during lab time.

I don't like lab9 because the differences between each library is huge. Agent.c is absolutly
too much to implemet. I think we didn't finishe the lab although it can pass test files. What
I learned in this lab is if you want to get high grades, find a good partner is the most important
thing. The thing I like about this labe is it play with hardware in a good way but seems we
missing "something" that like in the last lab we just know how to do printf but in this lab we
need to use it as a cpu.
