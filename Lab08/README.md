This lab isn't as hard as I thought before. I only need to finished one room and the rest of
the room are just the same as the first one. 

I finished the lab by following the manual. Although, the fail options are not clear, the manual 
told me what I should implement. 

I think I finished all of the lab. Although the manual didn't tell me how to do the makefile, 
I can know it by checking old makefiles before.
