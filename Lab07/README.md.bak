I finished all parts of the lab7 including extra credit. This lab need strong logic to trace
what you did in a state and what "interfaces" you left for future using. 

I tried to write down my logic in a paper, but it failed. Hence, I have to memory what I did
in each stage in order to implememt everything I need. 

Like what I said, I finished all of the lab including extra credit.
