1.I think the most important part is to build mml_test. It is a good tool to help you 
find your truble when you are not know. For this lab, I think implemet function isn't hard.
Finding your problem in your funtion is the hardest part. 

2.Like what I said, using mml_test to test your function is the best way to find problems 
in your code. I coded my first version of MatrixMath in a day. Then I think "that's it?". 
After I build mml_test, I found something that I even not noticed before like in matrixinverse. 
I used other fuuntions in here and I found each funtion can't cooporate like what I designed 
before. Then I figured them out. 

3.As for the hour. The first version cost 6 hours. Then finding and fix problems used 2 days. 
I don't like finding bugs but it is an essencial process for a code to be used. Courses helped
me to "understand" something at first, but only after I code it by myself, I can understand the 
meaning behind what Dr said. Hence, the course isn't useless but it also not such useful.
