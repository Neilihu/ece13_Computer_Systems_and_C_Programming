The lab is time consuming. I used more than 8 hors per day to figure something out. 
Because our grade still not presents on the Canvas, I don't knwo which part I'm doing 
good and which part I need to catchup. Over all this lab is not fun. My order for doing
this lab is do stack.c first then rpn.c then main. The stack.c is easy at first. But when
I was doing rpn.c I need to rewrite stack.c because something contradicted. the samething
happened in main.c. I need to rewrite both stack.c and rpn.c. I hope in the future we do
not need to work with this amount of files at once. 

my approach for this lab is tha everytime figure out one thing. it sounds easy but time
consuming. I need to imagine how the final works looks like. Then build each single step
one by one. if any small problem happened, in the unit test, I need to fix it. Hence, what
I was doing looks like iteration. 

I think I still have some problems need to fix but I don't have time. I have other courses'
homework need to do. A major problem I having is when user interact with calculator, he needs 
to type enter twice if they input character no more than max-inout-length. I really need
the grade for the previous labs to review my work and to save my time in the future.
