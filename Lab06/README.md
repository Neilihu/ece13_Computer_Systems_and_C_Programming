This lab is the first time I play with a hardwire (not scanf). Overeall, this lab is fun
because it isn't a logic strong lab. There are lots of easy understanding way to implememt
the same function. 

Because this lab isn't hard, I don't knwo what approach I shoudl say. Just start early.

I didn't do the extra credit because I can't figure out what "frozen" and "unfrozen" mean. 
If there is a video for it, I think I will do it. I finished other parts
