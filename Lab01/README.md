commentï¼šin the part 1 step 10, I meet a problem which is my broken point break. 
TA don't know how to deal with it but it can't influence the varibales' out-putting. 
Hence, I just ignore it. However, the green line which is needed in front also not showing. 
It may influence me in the future. I guess it just a setting problem like 
"showing stop-point or not after pause".
About the lab. This is the first week. Everything is new for student. Hence, I think, 
no matter how bad this week is, the lab is good if we can finished it step by step.
